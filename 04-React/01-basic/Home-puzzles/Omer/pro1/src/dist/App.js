The scramble was conducted by the 113th Fighter Wing of the D.C. National Guard, a U.S. official told CBS News. The NORAD aircraft were authorized to travel at supersonic speeds and a sonic boom may have been heard by residents of the region, NORAD said, adding that flares, which may have been visible to the public, were also used in an attempt to get the pilot's attention. Residents who happened to capture the sound of the fighter jets quickly took to social media, posting videos of the loud boom puncturing an otherwise seemingly quiet afternoon. ", "Haley Ott");
