1) create your favorite store(candy, games, movies, etc). the user can add an item,  update details on an item and delete items
2) create a "shooting ballons game." Create an array of balloons. Every balloon has an image. The balloon flies in random order. The color changes when you click on a balloon for the first time. The balloon exploded the second time and will be deleted from the array. The game ends when the array is empty.
