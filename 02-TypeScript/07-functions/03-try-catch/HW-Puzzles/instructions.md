1) Create a function that gets three numbers, multiplies them with each other, and returns the multiplication. Make sure with try-catch that all three numbers are numbers.
Get the three numbers from the user and print for the user the result of the function.

2) create a function that encrypts a word to numbers (e.g., hi -> 89) (h is 8th in the alphabet order, i is 9th in the alphabetic order). Check to see that only letters were entered.
let the user enter a message, and then return for her the encrypted code.

3) create the function in puzzle 2, but add another argument that tells the function to encrypt (letter to numbers) or decrypt (numbers to letters). If you want to challenge yourself, create a better encryption method.
let the user enter a message, and then return for her the encrypted code. let here also decrypt a massege.
