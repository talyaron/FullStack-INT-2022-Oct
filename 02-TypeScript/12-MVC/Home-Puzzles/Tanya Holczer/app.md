Baby daybook

Model: The app receives data about everyday baby functions, such as diaper change, sleeping, bottle/breastfeeding amount and duration, temperature, baths, doctor visits, pumping, etc. 
It also allows the user to upload photos of these functions and add notes. 

View: The app displays the time of each function, duration and amount per 24 hours. 


Controller: The app controller handles user input by summing up amounts, calculating trends and displaying them on a timeline and in graphic ways. 

For example:
when the user chooses bottle feeding, the model stores data containing amount fed, and then displays it on the screen. The controller sums up the amount of feedings on this day, the average amount per feeding, displays the trends for the past week/days 
and so on.
