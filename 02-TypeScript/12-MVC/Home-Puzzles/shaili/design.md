Model: The chat model handles the data for a specific chat, including the messages, participants, and other metadata. It also communicates with the server to fetch and send messages.

View: The chat view displays the messages in a specific chat to the user, and allows the user to compose and send new messages. It also displays the status of other participants in the chat.

Controller: The chat controller handles user input from the chat view, such as sending a new message or changing the chat settings. It updates the chat model and view accordingly.

For example, when a user wants to send a message:

They type the message in the view (chat view)
The controller receives the input and validate the message
If the message is valid, the controller updates the model (chat model) with the new message and sends the message to the server
The controller updates the view (chat view) to show the sent message
