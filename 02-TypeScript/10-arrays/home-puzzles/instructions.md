Create an array of products in a shop (for instance, a clothes shop).
In the array, put several items. Each item has price, name, and department (for example, "women's tops," "man underwear," etc.), and type (for example, "shirt," "trousers").


1. get all the items in a type (all "shirts")
2. find the cheapest item.
3. sort all items in a department by price. Show the cheapest on the top of the array.
4. find an item in the array by its name, using part of the name. for instance, the user will search for "je" and will get "Dizzle jeans.", "Levies Jeans", etc.
