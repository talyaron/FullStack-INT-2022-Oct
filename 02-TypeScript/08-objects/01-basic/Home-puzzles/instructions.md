Create data for Blockbuster:
Create an interface for videos and an interface for users. The video has a price property (in US dollars). It also has a property about who is the person that rented it.

1. create a function that gets a video object and returns the price in shekels
2. create a function that gets a video and a person and returns the object of the video, with reference to the person that took it.
3. Blockbuster was busted. You are now a developer at Netflix. Think of a way to let a user to have many videos. And the video has a list of all the people that viewed it.
