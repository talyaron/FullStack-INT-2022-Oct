Think about a project. The project can be something you like, an app, a game, or a site.
The project should have at least two entities, two pages, and one style.scss.

Use the BEM model in your scss.

If you do not have a idea for a project, build a store with an admin page and a store page.

The project should be ready in one week.

Doing the store project will give you maximum of 90 points.

Done.
