        Hello and welcome to my experiment in NODE.EXPRESS.JS
      </h1>
      <h2 class="Summary">
        In the last few days, my friends VLADI and ITAI G and I started a very
        special <span>team project</span> Although this should have been relatively simple
        We encountered social problems and also hardware difficulty which we
        tried to operate in the best possible way After a group effort we
        managed to finish the task on time but as with any code at the end we
        had a bug that in the very last seconds of submitting the project we
        took care of and were able to submit a special work that works! I would
        be happy to take you back a little and show you the path we have taken
        And the changes the project has undergone!!!
